This is a modification of the example at https://wiki.mythtv.org/wiki/Arduino_Infrared_Remote_Control for the back Hauppauge RC6 remote control.

Requires a compatible IR receiver connected to pin 2.  I am suing a random one salvaged from some junk.

The board needs to support USB HID.  I am using a Teensy 3.2.
